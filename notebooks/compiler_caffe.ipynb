    "In this notebook, you will learn what steps are required to prepare and compile a model. Before being able to deploy networks/models to Xilinx FPGAs you will need to compile them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This step is more than just converting the framework graph representation to one Xilinx can execute. The xfDNN Compiler is a high performance optimizer for Machine Learning inference. Some of the techniques it performs are fusing and merging layers, optimizing memory usage and pre-scheduling complete network deployment. These techniques increase inference rates and lower inference latency. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the xfDNN Compiler is an offline process, which only needs to be performed once per network/model. As you will see, the process is simple and quick. \n",

This will restrict the memory available to the compiler and it will automatically create DDR transfer commands to move intermediate results between the FPGA and DDR. You will see the DDR transfers is no longer 0 bytes.\n",

    "Lastly, 56 or 28 are supported as the DSP argument, so change this to 28. This corresponds to the 28x32 DSP configuration which reduces the number of DSPs compared to 56x32, but allows us to run twice as many CNN processing engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Because Resnet-50 has more opportunities to optimize the graph, and the model parameters are approximately 2x the size of the GoogLeVet-v1 model, it will take slightly longer to write the optimized weights run compared to the previous GoogLeNet-v1 example."
