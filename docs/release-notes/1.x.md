- Tensorflow: 1.8
 - Darknet (Specifically for YOLO)
- Supported Layers
  - Convolution 
  - ReLU  -  supported following Convolution / Eltwise Layers
  - Pooling
  - Deconvolution (Only compiler support, runtime is pending)
  - Concat
  - Eltwise (sum)
  - BatchNorm
  - Scale
  - Slice 
  - Layers supported in CPU:
    - InnerProduct

## Release 1.2

### New Features
- Added support for 2018.2 XRT, and Alveo-U200
- New Jupyter Notebook available:
  - Image Classification with TensorFlow 
- Benchmark utility script added (GoogLeNet, ResNet50)
- Enhanced Documentation with API markdown guides
- Added Power 9 Support


### Bug fixes
- Improved layer merging optimizations
- xdnn.computeFC optimized for 2x speedup w/ vectorized numpy implementation
- xdnn.computeSoftmax optimized for 10x speedup w/ vectorized numpy implementation
  - In the future we will move to C++ implementation
- Fixed bug where image dimensions mod 32 would cause invalid preprocessing, and zero detections

### Known Issues
 - examples/classification/test_classify_async_multinet.py - incorrectly reloads network schedule in some circumstances

## Release 1.1

### New Features
- Added Jupyter Notebook Support 
- New Jupyter Notebooks available:
  - Image Classification with Caffe 
  - Using the xfDNN Compiler w/ a Caffe Model
  - Using the xfDNN Quantizer w/ a Caffe Model
  - Object Detection w/ YOLOv2 + Darknet to Caffe conversion 
- Image Classification Googlenet Demo for VCU1525 
- Enhanced Documentation with ML Suite Overview, Overlay Selector Guide and  FAQ
- Introducing Nimbix Support 
- Updated SDx DSA support to `xilinx_vcu1525_dynamic_5_1` for VCU1525 and Nimbix 

### Bug fixes
- AWS overlay names have been updated, removing 'aws' prefix
- General Enhancements and Bug fixes for xfDNN Compiler/Quantizer
- Batch Nom layers implementation corrected from Darknet
- Default file permission fixed
- Root dir issues involving "ml-suite" resolved
- xdnn.execute api no longer needs images/batch argument
- Quantizer updated to allow for custom file names for output files
- xdnn_io updated to return 'none' if there are not FC layers in network

### Known Issues
* Batch Normalization layers not supported by the quantizer
* Local Response Normalization layers not supported 
* Hardware solution for average pool causes some accuracy loss, to be fixed in a future release
* Standard ReLU is the only supported non-linearity (Leaky ReLU Networks must be modified/retrained

## Release 1.0

This release is the first push of Xilinx's ML Suite to Github.  
Releasing to github will enable rapid release cycles, a smaller release footprint, and open source contribution.

### New Features
* FPGA Accelerated Image Classification, support for many networks
* FPGA Accelerated Object Detection, YOLOv2 support
* Python API for deploying inference to FPGA
* Precompiled xfDNN Library
* Updated Support for xDNNv2

### Known Issues
* Batch Normalization layers not supported by the quantizer
* Local Response Normalization layers not supported 
* Hardware solution for average pool causes some accuracy loss, to be fixed in a future release
* Standard ReLU is the only supported non-linearity (Leaky ReLU Networks must be modified/retrained)
