# ML Suite v1.2 Release Notes

### New Features: 

- Added support for 2018.2 XRT, and Alveo-U200
- Fallback to 2017.4 runtime
- New Jupyter Notebook available:
  - Image Classification with TensorFlow 
- Benchmark utility script added (GoogLeNet, ResNet50)
- Enhanced Documentation with API markdown guides
- Added compiler support for xDNNv3 

### Bug fixes
- General Enhancements and Bug fixes for xfDNN Compiler/Quantizer
  - Improved layer merging optimizations
- xdnn.computeFC optimized for 2x speedup w/ vectorized numpy implementation
- xdnn.computeSoftmax optimized for 10x speedup w/ vectorized numpy implementation
  - In the future we will move to C++ implementation
- Fixed bug where image dimensions mod 32 would cause invalid preprocessing, and zero detections

### Framework Support and Layers
