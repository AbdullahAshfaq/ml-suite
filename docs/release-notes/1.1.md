# ML Suite v1.1 Release Notes

### New Features: 

- Added Jupyter Notebook Support 
- New Jupyter Notebooks available:
  - Image Classification with Caffe 
  - Using the xfDNN Compiler w/ a Caffe Model
  - Using the xfDNN Quantizer w/ a Caffe Model
  - Object Detection w/ YOLOv2 + Darknet to Caffe conversion 
- Image Classification Googlenet Demo for VCU1525 
- Enhanced Documentation with ML Suite Overview, Overlay Selector Guide and  FAQ

- Updated SDx DSA support to `xilinx_vcu1525_dynamic_5_1` for VCU1525 and Nimbix 

### Bug fixes
- AWS overlay names have been updated, removing 'aws' prefix
- General Enhancements and Bug fixes for xfDNN Compiler/Quantizer
- Batch Nom layers implementation corrected from Darknet
- Default file permission fixed
- Root dir issues involving "ml-suite" resolved
- xdnn.execute api no longer needs images/batch argument
- Quantizer updated to allow for custom file names for output files
- xdnn_io updated to return 'none' if there are not FC layers in network

### Framework Support and Layers
- Caffe: 1.0.0
- Tensorflow: 1.8

- Supported Layers
  - Convolution
  - ReLU  -  supported following Convolution / Eltwise Layers
  - Pooling (MAX)
  - Deconvolution
  - Concat
  - Eltwise (SUM)
  - BatchNorm
  - Scale
  - Slice
  - Layers supported in CPU:
  - InnerProduct
  - Softmax

### Known Issues
* AWS Overlays - Only overlay_2 and overlay_3 are available, and they are clock rate reduced. The overlays will be updated shortly, and will offer better performance post update. 
* Networks expecting inputs of 128x128x3 will not function. There is a bug with image preprocessing in xfdnn. To be fixed shortly.
* quantize.py: See note below:
```
The quantizer expects a particular naming convention to be used in the deploy prototxt for caffe flows
Layer names must match the name of the "top" blob.
This is a common convention followed by most models
In the future we will add code to alleviate this requirement
```
* test_classify and batch_classify scripts for VGG16 result in segmentation faults.
* test_classify and batch_classify scripts for networks with average pool layers, e.g., MobileNet and Inception v3, do not produce desired accuracies, to be fixed in a future release.
